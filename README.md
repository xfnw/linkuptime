# linkuptime

visualize the uptime of irc links from `STATS l`, using graphviz

this repository contains two implementations with different
sets of features:

- rust
  - plaintext only
  - dark theme only
  - also shows length of longest path
- python
  - tls
  - light and dark themes
  - will probably stop working when python does more breaking changes
